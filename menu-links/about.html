        <p>
            Hey there, my name is Gaby and I come from a long line of non-techy folk, but I'm about to change that, or at least I'm trying to anyway!
        </p>
        <p>
            There's not much to say about myself really.  I come from a mixed background, my mum was English and my dad was Bengali.  I live in London with my partner and my dog!
            I love to read, that's my most enjoyed hobby if not coding. I read all sorts but my favourite genre is dystopian.  I also like to cook, I became a vegan nearly 10 years ago so I like to experiment with what meaty dishes I can make vegan, 
            whilst also making the meaty version as I'm the only vegan in the house!  I also really love to travel, I know it's cliche.  
            I used to work as an outdoor activity instructor, teaching young and old alike in adventure pursuits such as climbing, kayaking, paddleboarding, 4x4 driving etc. I love to pursue these activities
            in my own time too, mainly climbing and canoeing.  
            I have done a fair amount of work with animals in the past too.  I currently work in a biomedical research facility as a research technician. All this with a completely irrelevant degree in Wildlife Photography! Was my education a complete waste?  
            A question I find myself asking most often. <br>
            Now I've come to a point in my life where I need to seriously think about an actual career I want to stick with.  That's where web development comes in and that's where I am now!
