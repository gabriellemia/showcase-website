        <h2>So why coding?</h2>
        <p>In all honestly, I fell into coding during covid times.  Before then, I hadn't even considered coding as a hobby let alone a career.  I had no experience in the tech world aside from how to use office and send an email, pretty much.
            To tell you the truth I was scared of computers, as silly as it sounds. "If I press the wrong button, the machine will surely implode!", that was my thought pattern, more or less.  I hated IT in school as I felt like everyone was so much further ahead than
            me and that made me lose motivation as I thought I was stupid.  I grew up in the 90's when the internet and owning a personal computer was just becoming a major thing to the public.  We never had a computer growing up.  So any chance I had to explore them was time limited, so in a classroom basically,
            and everything seemed so rushed, I felt like I was expected to be at a certain level already, and of course, this pushed me further away from it.<br>
            So anyway back to present times.  The long stretch of time we had during lockdown got me thinking about what I was doing with my life...as I'm sure it did for so many others too. I wasn't happy in my current job, I hadn't been for a while.
            The problem was, I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do.  What can I do that I will really enjoy...that I can actually make a living from?  That must be the most asked question of all time!
            It's not difficult to see the direction the world has taken since the 90's, and the speed at which technology has advanced.  Though it became more apparent in 2020 when we had to start relying on online services more than ever.
            So that's where my thought process was taking me.  Something I could do from my computer!  Great, that's a start then.  This would also allow me to travel a little more as I could potentially take my work with me.  So bonus points there.
