        <h2>So why coding?</h2>
        <p>In all honestly, I fell into coding during covid times.  Before then, I hadn't even considered coding as a hobby let alone a career.  I had no experience in the tech world aside from how to use office and send an email, pretty much.
            To tell you the truth I was scared of computers, as silly as it sounds. "If I press the wrong button, the machine will surely implode!".  I wasn't keen on IT in school as I felt like everyone was so much further ahead than
            me and that made me lose motivation as I thought I was, well... stupid.  I grew up in the 90's when the internet and owning a personal computer was just becoming a major thing to the public.  We never had a computer at home growing up, so any chance I had to explore them was time limited (in a classroom),
            and everything seemed so rushed. I felt like I was expected to be at a certain level already, and of course, this pushed me further away from it.  Other girls in my class were coding little bits of HTML and CSS to build their Myspace profiles, and there's me discovering that there was such a thing as an instant message! So yeah, 
            that was my early experience with computers and until recently I had always believed the tech scene was beyond my reach, another world that I would never understand, and I had no right to pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
            So anyway, the long stretch of time we had during lockdown got me thinking about what I was doing with my life...as I'm sure it did for so many others too. I wasn't happy in my current job, I hadn't been for a while.
            The problem was, I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do.  What can I do that I will really enjoy...that I can actually make a living from?  That must be the most asked question of all time!
            It's not difficult to see the direction in which the world was moving, and the speed at which technology has advanced.  Though it became more apparent in 2020 when we had to start relying on online services more than ever.
            So that's where my thought process was taking me.  Something I could do from my computer!  Great, that's a start then.  This could also allow me to travel a little more too as I could potentially take my work with me if the opportunity should arise.  So bonus points there.

        </p>

        <p>It was initially these thoughts that got me looking into computer based work. I won't bore you too much with my thought processes after this, so skipping ahead to the decision to dive into web development ...
            A computer engineering friend suggested to me that coding may be something I'd want to consider. At first the whole notion was insane to me, like I said, computers were not my domain, I couldn't even consider entertaining the idea.  But I also had a niggling feeling that I wanted to find out more, it was bugging me that in a world that was so technologically advanced, I knew nothing.
            So with a bit of a push, I picked up a couple of my friends books on c++ to rifle through, just to get an idea, thinking "there's no way I will make any sense of this!" To my surprise and somewhat bewilderment however, I was able to 
            understand the basic concepts. After a little bit of tinkering, I was able to create my first "Hello, World!". As simple as it was, I couldn't believe it.  Maybe there was something in this after all. I continued to research into the paths this could lead to and what sort of education I might need in order to succeed. At this point I came across Web Development.  
            Coming from a somewhat arty background I felt drawn to this as it meant I could potentially use my creative side again, to build something of use to someone. This sounded perfect!  I'd also read that it was most likely the easiest way to start learning how to code for a complete beginner, and it meant I could learn both front-end and backend-end development, which 
            could be useful if I should decide to switch into a different tech field later on in my career.
        </p>

        <p>
            There has been much debate (in my head) in regards to whether I need a degree or some sort of formal education and qualification in order to secure a job in the field.  After looking into the matter in more depth, I found that many people had made it in the industry having taught themselves. Learning entirely from free online courses,
            videos, tutorials etc.  I figured, if others can do it, why can't I? I wasn't in a financial situation that would allow me to quit my job and commit to full time education again.  All I had was the drive and the want for this so much that I would be disciplined enough to sit down for a few hours every day, outside work hours, and commit my time to learning how to code.  I would do this for my future, if I wanted things to change!
        </p>

        <p>
            Back to present day and that's where I am now. I have been learning to code in my free time since then, using any resources I can find online, in books, talking to others etc.  I am currently following a course (The Odin Project), which includes everything you need to learn as a beginner from knowing absolutely nothing, to becoming a full stack web Developer.
            This course is fantastic as it gives structure to your learning, only moving onto new concepts once you understand the pre-requisites for it, and solidifying that knowlege with practice and projects.
            I am nowhere near a proficient developer yet of course, I am still a beginner, there is still a long way to go and I look forward to seeing where it leads.  Until then, I am enjoying every moment, and I have discovered that it is indeed actually something I can do, regardless of having no background in tech!  This knowledge makes the process all the more rewarding.
